PAC-MAN Clone (Nand2Tetris Jack)
A clone of the classic PAC-MAN arcade game, implemented in the Jack programming language as part of the Nand2Tetris curriculum. Developed during my time at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita School of AI, this project recreates the iconic game where PAC-MAN navigates a maze, eats dots, and avoids ghosts, all running on the Hack computer platform.

Features:
Classic Gameplay: Control PAC-MAN to collect all dots in a maze while evading four ghosts.
Scoring: Tracks points for dots with game-over conditions.
Multiple Lives: Player has 3 lives, when they die, score decreases by 200.
Speed: Made the ghosts and pacman increase their speed with prolonged gameplay, making it more interesting and fun to play
Jack Implementation: Built using the Jack language, compiled to Hack VM code.
Hack Platform: Runs on the Nand2Tetris Hack computer emulator with a 512x256 pixel monochrome display.
Input Handling: Uses keyboard inputs (e.g., arrow keys or WASD) for navigation.


Tech Stack:
Jack: High-level language from Nand2Tetris for game logic and implementation.
Nand2Tetris Tools: Includes the Jack compiler, VM emulator, and Hack computer platform.
Hack VM: Executes the compiled Jack code for the game.

Prerequisites:
To run this project, you need:
Nand2Tetris Software Suite (includes Jack compiler, VM emulator, and assembler).
A text editor for Jack files (e.g., VS Code, Notepad++).
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run the Nand2Tetris tools.
